      <h1>Once A Coporate Lady</h1>
      <p>
        Many moons ago when the passion of cooking could not pay the bills I had
        to switch jobs and ended up working in Public Government and later
        switched to the private sector working in HR.

      <h2>Later A Teacher</h2>
      <p>
        At a crossroad in my life I later took a job as a volunteer in Georgia
        teaching English, best 2 years of my life children can teach you so much
        about yourself.
